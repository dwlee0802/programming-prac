Thought it would take a couple minutes since its just printing a couple lines.
Took much more work than what I expected since my computer and VSCode didn't have compilers and paths set up for C++.
Also there were issues with Korean not being printed properly due to encoding.
Made me realize that I got complacent with CLion and Python and school projects.
