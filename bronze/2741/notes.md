Another easy problem but good for recap.
stoi - defined in <string>
input args start at index 1 0 is for the program name

Dang took more tries than I expected again.
1. endl is slower than just doing \n due to it also flushing the buffer
2. the input params for the problem are given as user input rather than the program parameters
